### 🔧 Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (modern web UI)
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas & Numpy
- **Visualizations**: Plotly (interactive charts)
- **Python Version**: 3.13+ compatible
- **Environment**: Virtual environment with all dependencies

## 💰 What the Tool Calculates

### Core Revenue Analysis
1. **Commission Revenue**: Your platform's earnings per event
2. **Break-Even Analysis**: Minimum commission rate needed
3. **Cost Breakdown**: Detailed expense analysis including:
   - Payment processor fees (Stripe, PayPal, MercadoPago)
   - MATIC/Polygon blockchain costs
   - Seats.io booking fees
   - AWS infrastructure costs

### Advanced Features
- **Multi-Event Planning**: Analyze multiple events simultaneously
- **Revenue Projections**: 12-24 month forward projections
- **ROI Analysis**: Return on investment per event
- **Commission Optimization**: Find optimal rates (7-15% range)

## 🎯 Key Business Insights

### Commission Rate Strategy
Based on your cost structure from the AWS table:

**For Small Events (500 tickets, $25 avg price):**
- Break-even typically around 8-10%
- Recommended range: 10-12% for profitability

**For Large Events (2000+ tickets):**
- Break-even typically around 6-8%
- Recommended range: 8-12% for optimal margins

### Cost Factors Included
✅ **Payment Processing**: Real-world rates
- Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- PayPal: 3.49% + $0.49 per transaction  
- MercadoPago: 3.99% + $0.25 per transaction

✅ **Blockchain Costs**: MATIC/Polygon
- NFT Minting: ~$0.002 per ticket
- Transfer: ~$0.001 per ticket

✅ **SaaS Services**: Seats.io
- Base monthly: $50
- Per booking: $0.05 per ticket

✅ **Infrastructure**: AWS (from your table)
- Básico: $964/month
- Moderado: $1,445/month
- Intenso: $2,535/month
- Máximo: $6,166/month

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

### Option 1: Quick Start
```bash
cd E_Ticketing_Revenue_Estimator
python3 run_app.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
cd E_Ticketing_Revenue_Estimator
source venv/bin/activate
streamlit run app.py
```

### Access the Application
- The app will automatically open in your browser
- Default URL: http://localhost:8501
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## 📊 Using the Application

### Single Event Analysis
1. **Set Parameters**: Ticket price, quantity, occupancy rate
2. **Choose Infrastructure**: Select AWS tier based on load
3. **Payment Mix**: Set processor distribution
4. **Analyze**: View revenue charts, break-even analysis, cost breakdown

### Multi-Event Analysis  
1. **Add Events**: Input multiple events with different parameters
2. **Compare**: ROI analysis across events
3. **Project**: 12-month revenue forecasting
4. **Optimize**: Find best-performing event configurations

## 🎯 Example Business Case

**Concert Event Example:**
- 1,000 tickets at $50 each
- 85% occupancy (850 tickets sold)
- 10% commission rate
- Moderado infrastructure

**Results:**
- Final ticket price: $55.00
- Gross revenue: $46,750
- Commission revenue: $4,250
- Total costs: ~$1,800
- **Net profit: ~$2,450 per event**

## 🔮 Next Steps

Now that your revenue estimator is ready, you can:

1. **Test Different Scenarios**: Try various ticket prices and commission rates
2. **Plan Your Events**: Use the multi-event analyzer for quarterly planning
3. **Optimize Costs**: Experiment with infrastructure tiers
4. **Scale Analysis**: Model growth scenarios with multiple simultaneous events

## 🤝 Future Enhancements

The codebase is designed for easy expansion:
- Add more payment processors
- Include marketing/acquisition costs
- Implement seasonal demand modeling
- Add competitor pricing analysis
- Create automated reporting features

## 📝 Notes

- All cost estimates are based on current market rates (May 2024)
- Blockchain costs may vary with MATIC price fluctuations
- Consider volume discounts for high-transaction scenarios
- Validate final pricing with actual service provider quotes
